# TDF-ECM-v001

The files in this repository can be used to analyze tilted dark field electron correlation microscopy (TDF-ECM) data.

File 01 aligns a time series of TDF TEM images by registering every frame with respect to its previous frame.

File 02 aligns a time series of TDF TEM images by registering every frame with respect to the first frame of the dataset.

File 03 calculates the intensity time auto-correlation (g2) for every pixel.

File 04 performs a KWW fitting on the calculated g2 values to determine the fitting parameters and generate spatial maps of relaxation time and stretching parameter.
